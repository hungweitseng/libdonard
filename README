The donard library contains common code for writing applications that
DMA memory directly between NVMe devices and Nvidia GPUs. This package
contains the libdonard.so sources as well as some example applications.

The examples include:

* imgrep: Attempts to find a single needle sub-image in a large
  haystack of images.

* imrot: Rotates a large number of images, inplace, 180 degrees.

There are also some executables for benchmarking the DMA transfer rates.
These are called nvme2gpu_read and nvme2gpu_write. Similar programs
are also provided for benchmarking DMA transfers to any mmappable PCI
address. These are nvme2map_read and nvme2map_write.
